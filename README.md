An AI powered education platform, Providing unique and customizable experience for its users.

Welcome to our AI powered education platform project! This project aims to provide a unique and customizable learning experience for users who are interested in coding and data structure algorithms. Using React and Node.js, we have created a platform that integrates CHATgpt, an advanced language model, to help users learn coding in a more efficient and interactive way.

Our platform is designed to be open-source, meaning that the community can contribute to and improve upon the learning resources available on the platform. We believe that quality education should be accessible to everyone, which is why we are committed to making our platform freely available for all.

With our platform, users can access a variety of resources.Our ultimate goal is to create a community-driven learning platform that empowers learners of all skill levels to achieve their goals in coding and data structures.
